# What is Vagrant?

Vagrant is an open-source tool that provides a simple and easy-to-use command-line interface for creating and managing 
virtual machines. It is designed to automate the setup and configuration of development environments, allowing 
developers to work in a consistent and reproducible environment across different machines and platforms.

With Vagrant, developers can define a set of instructions, known as a Vagrantfile, that describe how to configure and 
provision a virtual machine. The Vagrantfile can be version controlled and shared with other developers, making it easy 
to collaborate on a project.

# How to provision a Virtual Machine using Vagrant?
- Create a provision.sh file in the same directory as the vagrantfile.
- Enter the relevant commands you wish to be called when the script runs, then save the file.
- In the vagrantfile file, add `config.vm.provision "shell", path: "provision.sh"` to the code.
- In the VScode terminal, command `vagrant up` (to launch the VM), will execute the provision script.
